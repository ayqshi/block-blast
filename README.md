carefully read the section below.
### I AM FUTZUMI,
- My previous [account](https://github.com/futzumi) was tragically lost in battle (via 2FA issues- lost iPhone data that contained my authenticator app info)<br>
- GOAL: Reverse engineer the [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futzumi/block-blast/refs/heads/main/index.html) into an open source project. <br>
- PLEASE: Contribute, Support, Provide Feedback and Ideas, Point out flaws to my code. (reach out via snap: futzumi, ayqshi. or leave an issue) <br>
- PROOF OF CREDABILITY: The [OG repo](https://github.com/futzumi/block-blast) includes MY snapchat, if u fr dont believe I am who i say, reach out.
- DO NOT ask for a personal client/feature, the project will be Open Sourced for personal development
- IMPORTANT: If you decide to redistribute a modified or unmodified version of either project without crediting the developers, DMCA exists, I'd rather not but don't piss me off.
- NOTE: This code does not contain any original source code to Block Blast, I will provide the differences in development below. (Details on the ios app are AI generated for viewer understanding)

# Block Blast!
## Original Game
-  Developed by Hungry Studio.
- Block Blast is a native iOS application, likely developed using Swift or Objective-C, as these are common for mobile game development. The exact tools used are not publicly disclosed by the developer.
- Does NOT support browser gameplay
- Includes ads
- Different game modes
- [Official App Download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/block-blast/id1617391485)
## Recreation
- Developed by futzumi and ayqshi.
- This project is an Open Sourced recreation of block blast, developed using avaScript and TypeScript
- This projects development heavily relies on [Cocos Creator](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine), support for the 420 movement, and uhh hard work and dedication ig.
- Both browser and Mobile Application support
- Plans for non disruptive ads in the far future, for now remains ad free. (ad container is visible but empty and not used)
- [Official Broswer Game](https://block-blast-three.vercel.app/)
- Official Mobile Application Download Instructions (cumming later) - WILL support iOS and Android
- Personal modding support (repo to focus more on this topic later)
- Futuristically will have more game modes



# Official App Installation
## iOS
- Before beginning, it is best you have knowlegde on profile configuration files and their uses/limits.
- A web clip is a configuration profile payload that provides a shortcut on the home screen to a specific URL, which can be configured to open as a full-screen web app without the Safari browser UI.
- For this game, the profile config is simply an offline web clip of a compiled HTML file.
## Android
- Just download a modded apk tbh or wait..
## Windows
- Uhm wyd?? should be common sense. u js need to download this repo and run the index.html file...

# Contributing
- For those I may be lucky to work with, I will fully respect and give you full credability to your additions on this project.
- I will only be implementing contributions that help further develop the game closer to it's orignal
- Additional mods, Features, and hacks will be provided (OBFUSCATED AND COMPILED) in a seperate repo, but not as part of the open source project
- 
# Troubleshooting
- If you come across an error, or something about the game that does not resemble the original, create an issue with details regarding your opinion/problem.
- provide error logs from console with the error or link an image of the issue
- any other web game devs coming at my throat for incompletion, just contribute if ur better than me tbh. (see the section above for more details)
# Todo List
### well first we gotta open source ts, all this is next tho
- highscore
- settings menu
- glow outline on blocks before blasting a column/row
- tutorial/guide if first time playing game
- remove ad container
- update sound effects and sprites


## Disclaimer 
I recieve no revenue or money from this project, it is purely for people to learn from reading the code, and to enjoy the original game experience on the browser.
