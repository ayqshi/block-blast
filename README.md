##Block Blast!##
<br>
This is project is a remake of "Block Blast!" created by Hungry Games Studio ported to the browser. 
<br>
The game code originated from an html5 block blast ad. I edited the code of that ad and I converted it into a full game, so some of the code may not be clean and may be obfuscated.
<br>
I am Currently looking for collaboraters to contribute to this project. In need of someone to support the game UI for a variety of devices and someone who can help modify the game to make it more like the original. To help make this into the best block blast clone and the first full fledged port, I'll need help
