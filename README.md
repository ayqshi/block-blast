## Installation Guide

### iOS

Before beginning, ensure you have knowledge of profile configuration files and their uses/limits. A web clip is a configuration profile payload that provides a shortcut on the home screen to a specific URL, opening it as a full-screen web app without the Safari browser UI. For this game, the profile config is simply an offline web clip of a compiled HTML file.

### Android

Currently, the best option is to download a modded APK or wait for the official release.

### Windows

Download this repo and run the `index.html` file for a seamless experience.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. Please ensure your contributions help develop the game closer to its original version. Additional mods, features, and hacks will be provided in a separate repo and will be obfuscated and compiled.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors or issues, please create an issue with details regarding your opinion/problem. Provide error logs from the console or link an image of the issue. Any web game developers are encouraged to contribute if they believe they can improve the project.
