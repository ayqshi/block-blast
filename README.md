# NOTE!!!
I AM FUTZUMI, I lost the previous account due to 2FA problems. I'm attempting this projects development.<br>
Unfortunetly, I have also lost my source to the game, which will be a huge set back for development. <br>
Right now, the goal is to reverse engineer the original released file into an open source project. <br>
I would honestly love to see some contribution, support, feedback, ideas, or even correction to flaws in my code. (Leave it in the issue section or contact me via snap: futzumi, ayqshi) <br>
Before contacting or reaching out, BE SURE to not ask for a personal client/feature, the project will be Open Sourced for personal development (provide credits to both futzumi/ayashi in your readMe if you plan to re-distribute.

# Block Blast!

Block Blast is a Tetris-like puzzle game, challenging to eliminate as many blocks as possible in a limited space to get a higher score. It's also a simple yet challenging elimination game with logic skills and layout strategies, and every move determines whether you can get a high score.

# Installation & Updates
For those who have already seen the first version of this project, you will notice it has less features then before. This is because I wanted to make the code more readable and proffesional. The features will be coming back, but multi device support needs to be worked on before release.

Offline Mobile app profile config coming soon (IOS/ANDROID SUPPORT)


## Troubleshooting
If you come across an error, or something about the game that does not resemble the original, create an issue with details regarding your opinion/problem
## Todo List
- highscore
- settings menu
- glow on blocks before blasting a column/row
- tutorial/guide if first time playing game
- remove ad container
- update sound effects and sprites

## Help needed with maintaining

This is a very big project, I can not maintain/update this enough on my own to visibly look like the original app. If you want to contribute to porting block blast to the web, find my contact information below.

## Disclaimer 

I recieve no revenue or money from this project, it is purely for people to learn from reading the code, and to enjoy the original game experience on the browser.
